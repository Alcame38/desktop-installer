# Desktop installer for Arch Linux

## What the point of it

I only try to make a script to configure automatically an Arch iso. At first the objective is to make a script which will be used for my device, but finally could be kind of an application.

## How will it be made of

I thought of a basic shell at first, but i have flutter and ansible in my head, could be a future version with it
